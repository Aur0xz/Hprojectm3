                  What is anorexia nervosa?
                </h2>
                <h3> Anorexia nervosa, usually just called anorexia or ana, is characterized by an intense fear of gaining weight, combined with body dysmorphia. The ones affected by this disorder base their self-worth on their weight and shape; to prevent weight gain, anorexic people severely restrict their caloric intake, and some use also laxatives and diet pills.
                  Treatment and recovery are initially refused by anorexic people, because they don’t feel sick enough, they don’t feel valid, or don’t want to get better as ana tricks them into thinking that it is a good thing for themselves.
                  
                </h3>
                <h2>What are its causes?</h2>
                <h3>The main cause is beauty standards, they favor thinness and associate it with success. Another cause can be perfectionist drives, and last but not least: bullying and body shaming are also one of the biggest causes of ana.</h3>
